2. Webpage optimization

- on the first picture we see the styling for mobile is a bit nehh because of the modal not covering the full page we see a part  of the giveaway page in the bottom this is also on pc also we would like to see the top of the modal and the bottom with opencase its always in the screen make between that a scroll function so you can scroll through the cards 

then for the second image we also see the same in the bottom a part of the giveaways tab we also see that we can see anything of the buttons in the top also we see a big screen with nothing under the animation lets put there your latest rewards so we can see a little stats highest value from a case something like that and make a feature where we can do auto spins so it automatically spins till your cases are finished it will go to the first modal then the case modal then the third modal and then again to the second modal auto include a turbo functions there to speed it a bit up you can control it with keyboard shortcuts and buttons

then for the third image you did better and shows everything but the bottom part has the same thing

look at image 4  and 5 together thats the admin panel but i dont see any spins thing in there also reorder it a bit to a nice ordered admin panel
