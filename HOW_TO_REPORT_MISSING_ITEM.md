# How to Report a Missing Item on SkinVaults

This guide will walk you through the process of reporting an item that is missing or has issues on SkinVaults.

## Two Ways to Report Missing Items

### Method 1: Report from Item Detail Page (For Existing Items)
Use this method when you're already viewing an item page and want to report an issue with it.

### Method 2: Report from Dedicated Page (For Items That Don't Exist Yet) ⭐ **NEW!**
Use this method when the item doesn't exist on SkinVaults at all - perfect for reporting completely missing items!

## Method 1: Report from Item Detail Page

### Step 2: Find the Report Button

The report button is available in two locations:

#### **Desktop View:**

### Step 4: Fill Out the Report Form

The report form has the following fields:

## Tips for Better Reports

✅ **Do:**
- Provide as much detail as possible in the "Reason" field

- Use the exact item name from Steam Market
- Include an image URL if available

❌ **Don't:**
- Submit duplicate reports for the same item
- Report items that are clearly working correctly
- Use vague descriptions like "it's broken" without details

## Finding Item Information

If you need to find item details for a missing item:

1. **Steam Market**: Go to `https://steamcommunity.com/market/`
2. Search for the item
3. Copy the exact name from the listing
4. The item ID is usually in the URL or item details

## Troubleshooting

### "Report button not showing"
